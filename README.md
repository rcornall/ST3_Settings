These settings are for matching the UI (sidebar) to the Monokai color theme as well as smaller indentation, font changes etc.  but keeping the nice folders icons and tabs from Soda UI theme. Also minor user settings like show minimap viewport and bold folders

-----------------------How----------------------------------------------

To change Soda UI theme add the Theme - SoDaReloaded.sublime-package to:
  ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Installed Packages (easier found going to Preferences->Browse Packages then up a directory and should see Installed Packages.
  
To change the User settings copy the Preferences.sublime-settings to:
  ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/ and overwrite
  or you can just go Preferences->User then copy the contents into it. Save and quit to make changes take effect.
